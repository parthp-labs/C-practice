# C Practice 🧠

A personal collection of **C programming practice codes** documenting my learning journey — from basics to memory management and problem-solving.

This repo contains a variety of small C programs I’ve written while learning the language, covering core topics like loops, arrays, strings, conditionals, functions, and more.  

## 📌 What’s in This Repository

📁 Several `.c` source files, each focused on a specific concept or problem:
- Basic arithmetic and input/output  
- String manipulation  
- Array operations  
- Control structures  
- Simple problem-solving  
- Matrix operations  
…and more!

All code is written for **learning and practice purposes**.
